        ## New Aircraft Request
        Please fill out the information below to add a new aircraft to the fleet configuration.

        **Automated Workflow:**
        - Upon submission, the workflow will automatically check:
          1. **Local aircraft data** (phpvms7-fares/aircraft_data_*.json)
          2. **SimBrief API** (https://www.simbrief.com/api/inputs.airframes.json)
        - If aircraft exists: weights will be validated automatically (warns if >5% difference)
        - Data source will be tracked: `local`, `api`, or `local+api`
        - If NOT found: you'll be notified that a custom SimBrief profile is needed

        **Important:** All weights must be validated against official sources (Airport Planning Manuals, Type Certificates, or manufacturer specifications).
