# ✈️ phpVMS7 Flight Schedule Generator


⚠️ WARNING: Do NOT Remove Lines from airports.txt

> Important: Never remove lines from the airports.txt file once you have generated and imported flights into phpVMS7. Doing so will cause flight numbers to change, leading to broken or duplicate flight imports. You may only add new lines at the end of the file.


---

## ⚡ Quick Reference

**Usage:**

```bash
python generate_flights.py BASE_AIRPORT_ICAO BASE_AIRPORT_IATA_CODE
```

Example:

```bash
python generate_flights.py MUCC CCC
```

- **BASE_AIRPORT_ICAO** → ICAO of your main airport (e.g., MUCC)  
- **BASE_AIRPORT_IATA_CODE** → IATA code for grouping & file naming (e.g., CCC)

**Input File:**  
Place a `airports.txt` file in the folder `MUCC_CCC`:

```
MUCC-CCC,KEYW-EYW
MUCC-CCC,MKJS-MBJ
MUCC-CCC,TNCM-SXM
```

**Output:**  
Generates CSV files ready for phpVMS v7 import:

```
MUCC_CCC_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_generated_phpvms_flights.csv
```

Each route pair produces **4 flights**:
- 2 Passenger flights (Outbound + Return)
- 2 Cargo flights (Outbound + Return)

# 📌 Description

This Python script automates the generation of flight schedules for phpVMS v7.  
It reads a list of airport route pairs, calculates flight distances via the AirportGap API, and generates passenger and cargo roundtrip flights with subfleets automatically assigned based on aircraft range.

---

## 📌 Features

- Generate 4 flights per route pair (Passenger Outbound, Passenger Return, Cargo Outbound, Cargo Return).
- Automatically calculates flight distance using [AirportGap API](https://airportgap.com/).
- Generates departure and arrival times dynamically based on distance.
- Assigns subfleets automatically according to flight distance and aircraft range.
- Splits generated schedules into multiple CSV files if they exceed 500 flights (ready for phpVMS import).
- Designed for **Aerocaribbean VA** but can be adapted for other virtual airlines.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `requests` module (`pip install requests`)
- AirportGap API token (free account at [airportgap.com](https://airportgap.com/))

   ```
3. Export your AirportGap API token:
   - **Linux/macOS:**
     ```bash
     export AIRPORT_GAP_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
     ```
   - **Windows (PowerShell):**
     ```powershell
     setx AIRPORT_GAP_TOKEN "your_api_token_here"
     ```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script using:

```bash
python generate_flights.py BASE_AIRPORT_ICAO BASE_AIRPORT_IATA_CODE
```

Example:

```bash
python generate_flights.py MUCC CCC
```

## ⚠️ Notes

- API requests are limited to **100 per minute**; the script will pause automatically if the limit is reached.
- If no `airports.txt` file is found in the folder, the script will exit.
- Flight numbers start at **1000** and increment automatically.
- Tailored for Aerocaribbean VA (`airline_code=CRN`) but can be modified in the script.

---

## 🛠️ Customization

- **Airline code mapping:** Modify `special_code_to_airline` dictionary.
- **Aircraft subfleets:** Update `airline_subfleet_by_flight_type` dictionary.
- **Aircraft ranges:** Update `aircrafts_range_by_icao` dictionary.

## 👨‍💻 Example Workflow

1. Create a file `MUCC_CCC/airports.txt`.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python generate_flights.py MUCC CCC
   ```
3. Confirm the script finds the input file.
4. Generated files appear in:
   ```
   MUCC_CCC/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/exported_MUCC_CCC_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_generated_phpvms_flights.csv
   ```
5. Import CSV files into phpVMS7.
